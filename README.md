# SDiZO1

Measurement of data manipulation algorithms on different data structures.

## Description

This repository contains the first project made for the data structures &
computational complexity theory class.

We were supposed to implement from scratch different data structures and operations regarding the CRUDE concept.

Implemented data structures:

- Array
- Doubly linked list
- Max heap
- BST tree with DSW algorithm

You can find detailed description of the project in the documentation section.

**Project documentation is written in polish**.
